# Travel-Network-Optimization-PS1
Travel Network Optimization (Vehicle Routing Problem) using Python (Modules: Pyomo, OR Tools).
Conducted research work on TSP (Travelling Salesman Problem), VRP (Vehicle Routing Problem), PDP (Pick-up Delivery Problem), OVRP (Open Vehicle Routing Problem).
Studied various heuristic and optimization algorithms to get the shortest path between ’n’ delivery locations in order to minimize
travel cost.
